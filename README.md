Instructions for setting up a WSL distribution with a graphical desktop using X11 forwarding to the host, in combination with XLaunch.

Be aware that while this provides a GUI desktop sufficient for most normal desktop applications, OpenGL support may be limited by the capabilities of your X server. Most open-source X servers only support up to OpenGL version 1.4. Some paid versions may offer support for more recent versions.
