Instructions for setting up a WSL distribution with a graphical desktop using X11 forwarding to the host, in combination with XLaunch.

Be aware that while this provides a GUI desktop sufficient for most normal desktop applications, OpenGL support may be limited by the capabilities of your X server. Most open-source X servers only support up to OpenGL version 1.4. Some paid versions may offer support for more recent versions.

For the instructions see the document: Create-wsl-desktop.md [here](https://github.com/NicoJanE/WSL-OS-With-GUI-Desktop/blob/master/Create-wsl-desktop.md)
